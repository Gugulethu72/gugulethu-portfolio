              Hi, I'm Gugulethu Nkabinde â€” a final-year Multimedia Computing student at Tshwane University of Technology, majoring in Computer Science. I'm passionate about combining technology, design, and storytelling to craft engaging digital experiences.
              My expertise spans Front-End Development, Graphic Design, Videography, and Content Creation. I specialize in building clean, responsive UIs with React and Tailwind CSS, and I have hands-on experience in photo/video production, editing, and branding.
              I also co-manage Splash TV, a growing YouTube channel with over 1,000 subscribers, where I produce, film, edit, and manage content strategy alongside my partner.
              I thrive in creative spaces where design meets code, and where visuals drive emotion and impact.
